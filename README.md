# Heltec-Esp32-LoRa-V2-Eagle-libraries
<i>Heltec Esp32 LoRa Eagle libraries file for those who want to pcb design with heltec board </i>
<br>I had been trying to searched for eagle libraries for this board and i found out that there's no such a things (or maybe i just didn't found it so whatever). Therefore i decided to make my own and share it to everyone, So i hope my file will save your time :)
<br>I have to say that i'm not a professional designer so this may not look good as it could be but it took my entire day to design it and i hope you guy understand
